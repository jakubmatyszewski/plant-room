<details>
  <summary><i>Light</i></summary>
Prefers bright, indirect light. It thrives in locations with ample natural light but can tolerate some shade. Direct sunlight should be avoided as it may scorch the leaves.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><i>Temperature</i></summary>
15°C to 24°C. It can tolerate slightly cooler temperatures, but it's best to avoid extremes of heat or cold.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><i>Watering & humidity</i></summary>
Pilea prefers moderately moist soil. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent overwatering, whichą can lead to root rot. It appreciates higher humidity levels, so misting the leaves occasionally or placing the plant near a humidifier can be beneficial, especially in drier environments.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><i>Soil</i></summary>
Well-draining soil is essential. A mix of potting soil, perlite, and peat moss or coco coir works well. Avoid heavy soils that retain too much moisture, as this can lead to root rot. Repotting every couple of years with fresh soil can help maintain the plant's health.

<details>
  <summary><i>Light</i></summary>
Spider Plants thrive in bright, indirect light but can tolerate lower light conditions. They can even adapt to some direct sunlight, although too much direct sun may scorch their leaves.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><i>Temperature</i></summary>
15°C to 24°C. They can withstand slightly cooler temperatures but are sensitive to frost and extreme cold.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><i>Watering & humidity</i></summary>
Prefer consistently moist soil during the growing season (spring and summer) but should be allowed to dry out slightly between waterings to prevent root rot. In the dormant season (fall and winter), reduce watering frequency. They tolerate average indoor humidity levels well but appreciate occasional misting, especially in dry environments.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><i>Soil</i></summary>
Well-draining potting soil is ideal for Spider Plants. A mix of standard potting soil with perlite or sand for added drainage works well. These plants also do well in hanging baskets with a lightweight, peat-based potting mix. Repotting every couple of years with fresh soil can help maintain their health.
